# tennis_wordle

This is a tennis wordle game. Inspired by the popular wordle game where players must guess the word of the day in six tries, the goal of this project is to guess the tennis player being described as quickly as possible. Currently this game focuses on active tennis players ranked within the top 100 of the ATP and WTA tours (both male and female). 

Clues that are provided include: 

* Country
* Age
* Gender
* Highest Ranking
* Total Titles Won
* Grand Slams Won
* Year Turned Pro

Color Meanings: 

* Green: If a particular category is highlighted green, it signifies the player the user has guessed matches the desired player in that specific category. For example, if the answer is Roger Federer, and the user guesses Novak Djokovic, the # of grand slam titles will be highlighted green since both players have 20 grand slam title wins.
* Yellow: The category will have an up or down arrow signifiying the value guessed is higher or lower than the desired player's value for that category. Use these hints to narrow down potential players.

The user is given six guesses before they will lose the game. Good luck!
